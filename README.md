1. **Create a Slack App**:
    - Visit [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app.
    - Under "OAuth & Permissions", add the `chat:write` and `chat:write:bot` scopes to your bot token.
    - Install the app to your workspace and obtain a new OAuth token.

2. **Add Token to GitHub Secrets**:
